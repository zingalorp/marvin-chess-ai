Marvin is a **human-like** chess transformer trained on millions of [Lichess](https://lichess.org) games. Unlike traditional engines that seek the absolute best move, Marvin is designed to mimic human play styles across skill levels (1200–2500 Elo).

It is **time-aware**, meaning it adapts its play based on remaining clock time, opponent rating, and time control.

## Architecture

Marvin uses a transformer architecture with token-based conditioning, using techniques from [Leela Chess Zero](https://lczero.org/blog/2024/02/transformer-progress/) and Daniel Monroe's "[Mastering Chess with a Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12272)".

Context (Elo, clock, time control) is injected via 6 conditioning tokens prepended to the 64 square tokens. The model produces three primary outputs:
1.  **Policy**: Move probabilities (including resign/flag).
2.  **Time**: A 256-bin classification for predicted thinking time.
3.  **Value**: Win/Draw/Loss probabilities.

### Model Sizes
*   **Small** (`CONFIG_SMALL`): ~**23M parameters**. Compact and fast; the default for inference.
*   **Large** (`CONFIG_LARGE`): ~**108M parameters**. Higher capacity for increased playing strength at a higher compute cost.

## Results

Marvin (23M params) has been evaluated against state-of-the-art human-mimicking models.

### Web Interface
The project includes a GUI for seeing prediction distributions, live parameter tweaking, experimenting, and playing against the model.

## Installation

Tested on Linux/WSL with Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zingalorp/marvin-chess.git
cd marvin-chess
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**Web interface:**
```bash
python -m inference.app
```

**UCI engine (PyTorch):**
```bash
python -m inference.uci_engine
```

**UCI engine (ONNX - lightweight, no PyTorch required):**
```bash
python -m inference.uci_onnx
```

The ONNX engine only requires `onnxruntime`, `chess`, and `numpy` - no PyTorch needed at runtime. For GPU acceleration, install `onnxruntime-gpu` instead.

## ONNX Export

To export the model to ONNX format for faster/lighter deployment:

```bash
python scripts/export_onnx.py
```

This creates two files in `inference/`:
- `marvin_small.onnx` - The model graph (~1 MB)
- `marvin_small.onnx.data` - The weights (~100 MB)

Both files are required and must be kept together.
